plumber 0.4.0
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
* BREAKING: Listen on localhost instead of listening publicly by default.
* BREAKING: Removed `PlumberProcessor` class and replaced with a notion of 
  hooks. See `registerHook` and `registerHooks` on the Plumber router.
* BREAKING: `addGlobalProcessor` method on Plumber routers now takes a list
  which are added as hooks instead of a Processor. Note that `sessionCookie`
  has also been updated to behave accordingly, meaning that the convention of
  `pr$addGlobalProcessor(sessionCookie("secret", "cookieName"))` will continue
  to work for this release.
* BREAKING: `sessionCookie` now returns a list instead of a Processor. Note 
  that `addGlobalProcessor` has also been updated to behave accordingly, 
  meaning that the convention of 
  `pr$addGlobalProcessor(sessionCookie("secret", "cookieName"))` will continue
  to work for this release.
* DEPRECATION: Deprecated the `addAssets` method on Plumber routers. Use 
  `PlumberStatic` and the `mount` method to attach a static router.
* DEPRECATION: Deprecated the `addEndpoint` method in favor of the `handle` 
  method for Plumber routers. Removed support for the `processors`, `params`, 
  and `comments` parameters are no longer supported.
* DEPRECATION: Deprecated the `addFilter` method on Plumber routers in favor 
  of the new `filter` method. Removed support for the processor parameter.
* DEPRECATION: Deprecated the `addGlobalProcessor` method on Plumber routers.
* The undocumented `setDefaultErrorHandler` method on Plumber routers now takes
  a function that returns the error handler function. The top-level function
  takes a single param named `debug` which is managed by the `debug` parameter
  in the `run()` method.
* Add support for `entrypoint.R` when `plumb()`ing a directory. If this file 
  exists, it is expected to return a Plumber router representing the API
  contained in this directory. If it doesn't exist, the bahvior is unaltered.
  If both `plumber.R` and `entrypoint.R` exist, `entrypoint.R` takes precedence.
* `plumb()` the current directory by default if no arguments are provided.
* Added a `debug` parameter to the `run` method which can be set to `TRUE` in
  order to get more insight into your API errors.

plumber 0.3.3
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
* `plumb()` now accepts an argument `dir`, referring to a directory containing
  `plumber.R`, which may be provided instead of `file`.

plumber 0.3.2
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
* Introduced the `do_provision()`, `do_deploy_api()`, `do_remove_api()` and 
  `do_configure_https()` functions to provision and manage your APIs on a 
   cloud server running on DigitalOcean.
* `source()` the referenced R file to plumb inside of a new environment that 
  inherits directly from the GlobalEnv. This provides more explicit control over
  exactly how this environment should behave.
* Added `@serializer htmlwidget` to support rendering and returning a 
  self-contained htmlwidget from a plumber endpoint.
* Properly handle cookies with no value. (#88)
* Don't convert `+` character in a query string to a space.

plumber 0.3.1
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
* Add a method to consume JSON on post (you can still send a query string in
  the body of a POST request as well).

plumber 0.3.0
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
* BREAKING CHANGE: serializer factories are now registered instead of the 
  serializer themselves. Thus, `addSerializer()` now expects a function that
  returns a serializer, and `Response$new()` now expects a serializer itself
  rather than a character string naming a serializer. Internally it is the 
  serializer itself that is attached to the response rather than the name of
  the serializer. This allows for a serializer to customize its behavior.
* Accept an additional argument on the `@serializer` annotation -- R code that
  will be passed in as an argument to the serializer factory. See example
  `09-content-type`.

plumber 0.2.4
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
* Add a filter which parses and sets req$cookies to be a list corresponding to
  the cookies provided with the request.
* Responses can set multiple cookies
* Bug Fix: conver non-character arguments in setCookie to character before URL-
  encoding.

plumber 0.2.3
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
* Set options(warn=1) during execution of user code so that warnings are 
  immediately visible in the console, rather than storing them until the server
  is stopped.

plumber 0.2.2
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
* Add `sessionCookie` function to define a processor that can be used as a
  globalProcessor on a router to encrypt values from req$session and store them
  as an encrypted cookie in on the user's browser.
* Added `setCookie` method to response which (primitively) allows you to set
  a cookie to be included in the response.
* Add `addGlobalProcessor` method on `plumber` class to support a processor that
  runs a processor only a single time, before and then after all other filters 
  and the endpoint.
* Document all public params so CHECK passes

plumber 0.2.1
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
* Add more Roxygen documentation for exported functions
* Remove the warning in the README as the API seems to be stabilizing.

plumber 0.2.0
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
* BREAKING: Changed variable-path routing to use bracketted format instead of
  just a colon.
* BREAKING: Renamed `PlumberRouter` R6 object to just `Plumber`.
* Support `addEndpoint()` and `addFilter()` on the `Plumber` object.
* Added support for the `#*` prefix.

plumber 0.1.0
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
* Initial Release
