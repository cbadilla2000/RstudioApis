\title{Start a server using \code{plumber} object}
\usage{
pr_run(
  pr,
  host = "127.0.0.1",
  port = getOption("plumber.port", NULL),
  ...,
  docs = missing_arg(),
  swaggerCallback = missing_arg(),
  quiet = FALSE
)
}
\arguments{
\item{pr}{A Plumber API. Note: The supplied Plumber API object will also be updated in place as well as returned by the function.}

\item{host}{A string that is a valid IPv4 or IPv6 address that is owned by
this server, which the application will listen on. "0.0.0.0" represents
all IPv4 addresses and "::/0" represents all IPv6 addresses.}

\item{port}{A number or integer that indicates the server port that should
be listened on. Note that on most Unix-like systems including Linux and
Mac OS X, port numbers smaller than 1025 require root privileges.}

\item{...}{Should be empty.}

\item{docs}{Visual documentation value to use while running the API.
This value will only be used while running the router.
If missing, defaults to information previously set with \code{\link[=pr_set_docs]{pr_set_docs()}}.
For more customization, see \code{\link[=pr_set_docs]{pr_set_docs()}} for examples.}

\item{swaggerCallback}{An optional single-argument function that is called
back with the URL to an OpenAPI user interface when one becomes ready. If
missing, defaults to information set with \code{\link[=pr_set_docs_callback]{pr_set_docs_callback()}}.
This value will only be used while running the router.}

\item{quiet}{If \code{TRUE}, don't print routine startup messages.}
}

\code{port} does not need to be explicitly assigned.
