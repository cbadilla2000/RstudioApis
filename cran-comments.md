## Reverse dependencies

* Revdep maintainers were not contacted as this release is for bug fixes and enhancements from particular maintainers.

* I have run R CMD check on the 3 downstream dependencies.
  * https://github.com/trestletech/plumber/blob/master/revdep/problems.md
  * No errors, warnings, or notes were introduced due to changes in leaflet

* All revdeps were able to be tested
