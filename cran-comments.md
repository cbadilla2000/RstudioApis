Bug fixes and new features.

CRAN checks:
* I have disabled the brittle test that is currently failing on r-oldrel-windows-ix86+x86_64 for windows platforms only
* `LazyData` field in DESCRIPTION has been removed
* I have disabled a test on windows involving `{future}` as I am running into https://stat.ethz.ch/pipermail/r-devel/2021-June/080830.html

Please let me know if there is anything else I can provide.

Thank you,
Barret
